                                    <p>Sherlock was silent as he walked down towards platform 9 ¾, his parents and other siblings.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Sherlock , sweetheart slow down we have plenty of time before the train leaves to Hogwarts
                                        ‘’ His mother called out as she walked along with his sister Imogen who was already
                                        entering her 3<sup>rd</sup> year at Hogwarts , she was a Ravenclaw Hufflepuff like
                                        their father.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Mother he’s just nervous can you not see that he’s quivering in his underwear?’’ His
                                        oldest brother Mycroft, who was in his last year, spoke in a mocking town. He hurried
                                        and rolled his trolley next to Sherlock’s who scowled.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Oh Myc why don’t you try to encourage and cheer on your brother a little more? You
                                        should take care of him at Hogwarts and If he sends one letter telling me of you
                                        teasing or ignoring him I will send a howler with something embarrassing!’’ she warned
                                        the older boy.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Mother but Sherlock never cheers me on!’’</p>
                                    <p>‘’Go fatty!’’ Sherlock muttered as he crossed the barrier of the secret 9 ¾, his sister
                                        and brothers following behind.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Mycroft, Sherrinford, Imogene and Sherlock all you lot get together! Timothy darling
                                        get the camera!’’</p>
                                    <p>‘’On it Wanda Honey’’ There mother instructed their father who quickly unshrunk the camera
                                        from his pocket , their four children got together uncomfortably and smiled for the
                                        camera which clicked as a bright light half blinded them from it.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Bloody hell Mum when are you going to stop doing that stupid tradition we aren’t children
                                        anymore except Shirley over here’’ Sherrinford grinned down at this shorter and younger
                                        brother.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Shut it you Slytherin’’ Sherlock narrowed his eyes and let go of his trolley as one
                                        of the workers on the train grabbed it and began to load it on the locomotive.</p>
                                    <p>‘’You two stop fighting I don’t want any of this do you hear me!?’’ Their mother warned
                                        again a bit more irritated that time.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Ay Sherrinford look…a muggle…’’ Their sister Imogene leaned over and whispered into
                                        Sherrinford’s ear as she eyed the muggle man who walked with his witch of a wife
                                        and magical children. Though Hufflepuff where considered nice and loyal they certainly
                                        weren’t to muggles , muggleborns or Half-bloods they understood ,but muggles themselves
                                        made them stay as far away.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Disgusting isn’t it how could someone marry a mugg-‘’ She was interrupted as their
                                        mother rushed past them to greet a friend.</p>
                                    <p>‘’ Genevieve! Aurelius’’ Their mother greeted the wizarding couple, they looked sophisticated
                                        and high class, but of course they would be. The Prince’s where basically Wizarding
                                        royalty as their bloodline came from Merlin himself and much longer before that,
                                        they were noble and well respected even by the more pompous Pure bloods , the Prince’s
                                        where scholars most of the family being made of Ravenclaws and Slytherin’s.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Eileen my dear’’ Their mother looked down at the shorter girl , long dark hair reaching
                                        her waist and eyes a frightening shade of green , her nose was petite and skin fair.
                                        She was a beautiful girl indeed and Wanda always thought that her little Sherlock
                                        and Eileen where a good pair.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Wanda, Timothy’’ Genevieve smiled back at the couple and acknowledged their children.
                                        ‘’How have you all been? I haven’t seen you in ages Wanda’’ The two mothers struck
                                        up a conversation as the children awkwardly stood there and waited for the train
                                        to signal its takeoff.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Hello…Sherlock’’ A girl spoke besides him, he tried not to shuffle away from the awkwardness
                                        of her voice.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Hello Eileen Prince, how long has it been since we’ve seen each other? 4 years?’’ Sherlock
                                        asked not turning around to face her, he knew it was rude but he just couldn’t stand
                                        it, did she expect to find Sherlock suddenly fall head over heels for her, start
                                        dating, get engaged and married and have the children both their parents expected?
                                        He suddenly found himself irritated by her presence.</p>
                                    <p>‘’2 years actually, I left to America for a while because they have schools there that
                                        start teaching earlier but my parents decided to take me out and instead put me in
                                        Hogwarts once I turned 11 which was back in August, though my mom was very sad because
                                        you know I’m the only child except my cousin Hydrus they adopted when I was 2 because
                                        his parents had died in a car acc-‘’</p>
                                    <p>‘’Eileen you’re rambling….’’ Sherlock said interrupting her.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Oh sorry I didn’t mean to ramble I just thought to inform you how long we haven’t seen
                                        each other, though we were friends when we were little remember red bea-‘’</p>
                                    <p>‘’EILEEN’’ Sherlock finally snapped and turned to face her, his mouth was turned into
                                        a deep frown.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Sorry Sherlock…’’ She whispered and turned to leave, there were tears brimming her
                                        eyes that she tried to wipe away.</p>
                                    <p>‘’You shouldn’t be mean to girls you know, she was just trying to talk to you’’ An unfamiliar
                                        voice spoke close to him. Sherlock turned to face a short dirty blonde headed boy
                                        whose hair was swept back.</p>
                                    <p>‘’it really isn’t of any concern to you…’’ Sherlock rolled his eyes at the shorter boy.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Yeah though I overheard the conversation you were quite rude, you won’t make any friends
                                        if you keep that up’’ Sherlock raised a brow and scoffed.</p>
                                    <p>‘’You’re that half-blood aren’t you? Well for your information I don’t need friends,
                                        their useless nasty little things’’ Sherlock spat back.</p>
                                    <p>‘’alright mate if that’s what you believe’’ The boy shrugged as he was about to leave.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Wait, I want to know your name so every test I take I may show you how friends don’t
                                        make my grades lower nor grow because I am a Holmes and a Holmes is a perfectionist
                                        !’’ The boy grinned turning to Sherlock, he placed his hands inside the robes he
                                        already wore and shrugged.</p>
                                    <p>‘’Figure it out yourself genius!’’ He gave a curt nod before disappearing into the crowd
                                        leaving Sherlock to stand there annoyed.</p>
                                    <p>‘’MUM!’’ he called out and rushed over to her. ‘’I’m saying goodbye earlier I need to
                                        do something’’ He said reaching up and kissing his mother, he rushed towards his
                                        father and hugged him before any of the two could say another word about it, he rushed
                                        down the rows of train carts and leaped into the one where all the luggage was organized
                                        by time of arriving, first letter of your first name and age. He would figure the
                                        boy’s name out no matter what.v</p>

                                        <p>Okay so I was trying to figure out the families, blood types and houses of everyone.
                                            Since Sherlock was rumored to have a brother I decided to fit him in THEN I found
                                            out another theory he had a sister because of clues in the actual books so I
                                            decided to put her in too they aren't totally OC's but their close enough right
                                            ? also tell me what you think about the other's Houses and Blood types ? as well
