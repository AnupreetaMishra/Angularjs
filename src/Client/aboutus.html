                                            quaternary services. This means Gurukripa has the personnel and facilities to
                                            provide advanced medical inquiry and treatments that are not widely accessible
                                            in this region.</p>

                                            Many of Gurukripa’s specialty programs consistently rank among “America’s Best Hospitals” and earned top honors in the first-ever

                                            739 beds, most patients come from Monroe County but over 35 percent come from

                                            <img alt="Our Team - Gurukripa Hospital" class="imgFrameRight resize" height="153px" src="Assets/img/Doctors/2.jpg">Gurukripa
                                            is an exemplary teaching hospital with advanced scientific proficiencies, robust
                                            patient care services, and formidable community relations. These qualities and
                                            the dedicated staff who support them are precisely what elevate Gurukripa’s reputation.
                                            As a teaching hospital, all of Gurukripa’s medical clinicians are clinician scholars
                                            with faculty appointments (at the University of Rochester School of Medicine
                                            and Dentistry) who supervise residents and participate in the education of residents
                                            and students. The result is a learning environment immersed in research, education,
                                            community, and innovation—Medicine of the Highest Order.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Gurukripa is also characterized by having medical clinicians who are comfortable working with many other specialists in an
                                            interdisciplinary, team-based environment. Familiarity and ease with this level
                                            of collaboration allows staff to harness the powerful interaction of three distinct
                                            but interrelated missions: research, education, and patient care. The fruit of
                                            this interaction is found in not only how clinicians teach but also how they
                                            practice. Indeed, all of Gurukripa’s staff is committed to consistently delivering
                                            a high quality patient experience. This includes working to build partnerships
                                            with patients and their families along with identifying ways to empower patients
                                            with information and the tools they need to make informed decisions about their
                                            health care.

                                        <h2>
                                            What This Means for You</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            As a result of Gurukripa’s approach, each and every patient has an extensive number of specialists who can be seamlessly
                                            integrated into their health care team. A condition is never isolated. Patients
                                            always have a team of people and specialists taking care of them, all supported
                                            with the highest technology. That technology also applies to communication. All
                                            of a patient’s medical information is consolidated into a single medical record
                                            thus eliminating potential for miscommunication.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            This means that if you go in for a standard procedure and there is a complication, a specialist is on hand to be instantly
                                            included into your health care team. Moreover, that specialist represents the
                                            most advanced medical care and research. When you combine this expertise with
                                            Gurukripa’s philosophy of developing a meaningful partnership</a>
                                            with patients and families the result is nothing short of a transformational
                                            patient experience.</p>
